Installation: 

First, put other_bots.py in the same directory as the Python files
from part one.

Next, at the top of my_bot.py add:
import other_bots

Usage:

After the line "bots = [MyBot()]", add:
bots.extend(other_bots.get_bots(5, 2))

This will add five fundamentals traders and two technical traders to
the simulation in addition to your bot. You should test with different
proportions of these traders, simulating different market
conditions. In general, the line:

bots.extend(other_bots.get_bots(num_fundamentals, num_technical))

...will create a simulation with 1 + num_fundamentals + num_technical
traders including your bot. You can include multiple copies of your
bot or other bots in the simulation by adding them to the list with
bots.append (for a single bot) or bots.extend (for a list of bots).

other_bots.py includes one type of fundamentals trader and two types
of technical traders (get_bots() splits num_technical evenly between
these two types). The technical traders use the price history only,
and do not make money on average: they simulate noise traders which we
often see in real markets.

Now that there are more bots participating in the market, you may want
to increase the lmsr_b parameter to decrease volatility. For example:
plot_simulation.run(bots, lmsr_b=250)
run_experiments.run(bots, simulations=1500, lmsr_b=250)
